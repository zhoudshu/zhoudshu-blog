### About this website

I created this blog for a dual purpose - the first purpose is to learn English. My English is Poor, Reading is good but Spoken or Writing is more bad than my ten years old daughgter. So this blog is English one, if Anybody do not understand the blog content, feel free to contact me by email. The second purpose is to record the problems and solution in my working and help others to solve the similar problem.
